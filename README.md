# CalculatorTechnicalExercise
This is my Python project to create a simple calculator and unit conversion tool.
 
The app is able to add, subtract, multiply and divide two numbers and convert between a range of different units.  It is a console based utility and can handle decimal numbers as well as whole numbers.
To test, from a computer with git installed run the command ‘git clone https://github.com/Benthomp3/CalculatorTechnicalExercise.git‘ to create your own local repository of this project.
 
You will need Python installed on the computer and then run CalculatorTechnicalExercise.py
